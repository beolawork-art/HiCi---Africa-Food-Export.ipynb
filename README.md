HiCi Ltd. EU Food Export Risk Analysis 

This project analyzes raw EU Food Safety Standard Agency data to determine key risk areas for HiCi Ltd.'s planned expansion into the European Union market, focusing specifically on border rejection events.

🔑 Key Findings

The analysis of 339 border rejection incidents revealed that the export risk is overwhelmingly concentrated:

| Determinant | Top Result | Count | 
| :--- | :---: | --- |
| Highest Risk Product | Nuts, nut products and seeds | 318 (94% of all rejections) | 
| Primary Country of Origin | Sudan | 180 (of the high-risk product) | 
| Primary EU Reporting Country | Greece | 223 (Highest volume of reports) | 
| Most Frequent Action | Re-dispatch | 96 (Consignment sent back) | 

🛑 Strategic Recommendation

HiCi Ltd. faces a critical vulnerability in its supply chain. The primary recommendation is a two-part strategy:

1. Immediate Mitigation: AVOID exporting the nuts, nut products and seeds category to the EU until comprehensive, third-party quality control measures are implemented to address contamination issues (e.g., Aflatoxins).
2. Market Penetration: Focus initial EU exports on low-risk product categories to establish a reliable trade presence while the high-risk supply chain issues are resolved.

🛠️ Tools & Methodology

- Data Preparation & Analysis: Python (Pandas) was used to clean the raw file (handling multi-row headers and stripping spaces) and perform core analytical counts and pivot table generation.
- Reporting: Results are presented via visualizations and a pivot table designed for executive review in a Business Intelligence environment.
